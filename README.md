# Automated-Plant-Watering-System
This is my automated plant watering system project. MATLAB was used to develop this automated watering
system. An arduino moisture sensor was put in the soil of the plant and it sent voltage data to the Arduino Mini Board. 
The mini board sent the data to MATLAB where it was displayed. Whenever the voltage dropped a certain amount, the program would 
send a signal to the board to pump water into the plant from a water pump. The water pump was connected to the mini baord as well.
